### **What is hashing?** <a href="#what-is-hashing" id="what-is-hashing"></a>

Hashing means using some function or algorithm to map object data to some representative integer value.

This so-called hash code (or simply hash) can then be used as a way to narrow down our search when looking for the item in the map.

### **How hashing works** <a href="#how-hashing-works" id="how-hashing-works"></a>

In hash tables, you store data in forms of key and value pairs. The key, which is used to identify the data, is given as an input to the hashing function. The hash code, which is an integer, is then mapped to the fixed size we have.

Hash tables have to support 3 functions.

* insert (key, value)
* get (key)
* delete (key)

## SHA-1

It is a string of 40 hexadecimal characters (0-9 and a-f) and is computed from the contents of a file or directory structure. The SHA-1 hash looks something like this: `24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373`
