### **The dot character**

The **dot** character `.` matches any single character including letters, digits, and so on, except for the newline character, unless it is specified.

The **question mark** `?` is a special character that means â€œthe preceding character or nothing". The question mark `?` signals that the character before it can occur once or zero times in a string to match the pattern.
