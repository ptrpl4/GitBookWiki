### (HTTP) cache

Implementation that holds requests and responses for reusing in subsequent requests. It can be either a shared cache or a private cache

### Terms

#### Shared cache

Cache that exists between the origin server and clients (e.g. Proxy, CDN). It stores a single response and reuses it with multiple users â€” so developers should avoid storing personalized contents to be cached in the shared cache.

#### Private/local/browser cache

Cache that exists in the client. It is also called _local cache_ or _browser cache_. It can store and reuse personalized content for a single user.

#### Store response

Store a response in caches when the response is cacheable. However, the cached response is not always reused as-is. (Usually, "cache" means storing a response.)

#### Reuse response

Reuse cached responses for subsequent requests.

#### Revalidate response

Ask the origin server whether or not the stored response is still [fresh](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#fresh\_and\_stale\_based\_on\_age). Usually, the revalidation is done through a conditional request.

#### Age

The time since a response was generated. It is a criterion for whether a response is [fresh or stale](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#fresh\_and\_stale\_based\_on\_age).

### Response types

#### Fresh response

Indicates that the response is [fresh](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#fresh\_and\_stale\_based\_on\_age). This usually means the response can be reused for subsequent requests, depending on request directives.

#### Stale response

Indicates that the response is a [stale response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#fresh\_and\_stale\_based\_on\_age). This usually means the response can't be reused as-is. Cache storage isn't required to remove stale responses immediately because revalidation could change the response from being stale to being [fresh](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#fresh\_and\_stale\_based\_on\_age) again.
