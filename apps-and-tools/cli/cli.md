## Syntax

### comments

```bash
# one line

git status # inline

: '
long
comment
'
```

### man

SYNOPSIS - most common options
OPTIONS - full list of options

```bash
# man examples
say
[-v voice] 
[-r rate] 
[-o outfile [audio format options] | -n name:port | -a device] 
[-f file | string ...]

# one more
command [params...] [-optionsâ€¦] | command_two <param> [-optionsâ€¦]

# another example
cmd [param 1|param 2] 
```

Square brackets`[]` means optional

Pipe `|` means "OR" when there can only be one of two option

`[-f file | string ...]` it could be OR file OR string, not both

The value of an option is indicated by a space after the option value itself. If the option value contains special or space characters, it must be enclosed in quotation marks, double or single

### params

Required parameters are written in angle brackets \<param> \
optional â€“ in square brackets \[param]\
To indicate that a parameter can be repeated, ellipses are used \[params...]
If only one of several parameters can be chosen, vertical bars are used: \[param 1|param 2]

### options

`--options` are **command line options** or **flags**, that modify the operation

short option `-o`

long `--option` (dash-dash-option)

### variables

[how-to-read-and-set-vars](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-linux)

```bash
# set shell var
MY_TASK="project-1955"
TOKEN="bblablatoken64"

# check value
echo $TASK

# usage
open https://main-url-$MY_TASK.nl-k8s-stage.srv.local\?token=$TOKEN

# unset
unset MY_TASK

# check shell vars
set | less

# covert to env var
export TASK

# check env vars
printenv | less
```


### Glob patterns (Globbing)

Typically globbing is about file names.

- `*` - Any character (except `/`) in any number, or no characters at all
- `?` -  Any one character
- `[]` or `{}` - A group of characters {file1, file3, file6} or a set [0-9] [a-zA-Z] or [p1K]
- `[!]` or `[^]` - Negation of group or set of characters; is used with square brackets, like [!1-5]

examples
```bash
rm file{1-6}

cp ~/.* /mnt/usb/

git add *.scm
```

Glob vs regex

Some symbols have the same meaning. These are symbols like curly brackets `{}` and square brackets `[]`.

`*` in glob means either zero or any number of characters
`*` in regex means zero or more of the previous character

`?` in glob means any one character
`?` In regex means zero or only one of the previous characters

`.` in regex means the same as what `?` means in globbing
`.*` in regex means the same as `*` in glob patterns
### pipe

| pipe - connect output first command to input next command

```bash
# copy public key to clipboard 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

# find keyword in ls results
ls ~/.ssh | grep digital

# check last commands in history
history | tail -20

# grep all with "m"
echo -e "Hmm...\nBrr...\nMmm..." | grep "m"
```

### math

#### Arithmetic operators

| Op. | Function       | Description                                    | Example    | Result |
| --- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| +   | Addition       | Add two operands                               | $((10+3))  | 13     |
| -   | Subtraction    | Subtract two operands                          | $((10-3))  | 7      |
| *   | Multiplication | Multiply two operands                          | $((10*3))  | 30     |

| **  | Exponential    | Raise the first operand to the power of second | $((10**3)) | 1000   |

```bash
#!usr/bin/env/bash

#Executing simple arithmetic operations
echo $(( 10*5+15 ))
echo $(( 40/6 ))
```

#### Operations with a variable
| Operator | Function                   | Description                     | Example     | Result |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| +=       | Addition by constant       | Add two operands                | $((_x_+=3)) | 13     |
| -=       | Subtraction by constant    | Subtract two operands           | $((_x_-=3)) | 7      |
| *=       | Multiplication by constant | Multiply two operands           | $((_x_*=3)) | 30     |

| %=       | Modulo by constant         | Return remainder after division | $((_x_%=3)) | 1      |

```bash
#!usr/bin/env/bash

# Assigning value to variables
val1=$(( 10*3-15 ))
echo $val1

# Arithmetic operations using constants
# both `val=$(( 2 ))` and `$(( val = 2 ))` to assign values to vars
echo $(( val1 *= 3 ))
```


#### Relational and logical operations

`bc` utility provides us the ability to work with previously described operators as well as:
- Relational operators
- Logical or Boolean operators
- Math functions
- Conditional statements
- Iterative statements

| Op. | Example       | Evaluation logic                  | Result |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| &&  | bc <<< "5&&6" | 1; if all operands are non-zero   | 1      |
| \|  | bc <<< "5\|6" | 1; if any one operand is non-zero | 1      |
| !   | bc <<< "!5"   | 1; if the operand is 0            | 0      |

```bash
#!usr/bin/env/bash

# syntax command argument <<< "input"
# Less than operator
bc <<< "10 < 1"

# Is not equal to operator
bc <<< "10 != 11"
```

#### Math library

option `-l` enables the standard math library

| Math func. | Explanation                                                        | Example             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| sine       | Takes radian value as operand and gives its sine value             | bc -l <<< "s(30)"   |
| cosine     | Takes radian value as operand and gives its cosine value           | bc -l <<< "c(30)"   |
| tan-1      | Gives the inverse tangent in radians                               | bc -l <<< "a(1)"    |
| _ln_       | Gives the natural logarithm                                        | bc -l <<< "l(45)"   |
| _e_        | Raises _e_(euler's number i.e. 2.7182) to the power of the operand | bc -l <<< "e(1)"    |
| âˆš          | Returns square root value                                          | bc -l <<< "sqrt(9)" |

```bash
#!usr/bin/env/bash

#Arithmetic operation that returns a floating-point number
bc -l <<< "(1 + 2)/7 * 2 ** 2"

#Using sine and cosine functions
bc -l <<< "s(1) + c(1)"

#Using logarithmic and exponential functions
bc -l <<< "e(1) + l(5)"

#Finding the square root of a number
bc -l <<< "sqrt(27)"

#Converting binary 10 to octal
bc -l <<< "ibase=2; obase=8; 10"

#Converting decimal 5 to binary
bc -l <<< "obase=2; 5"

#Using scale to control length of floating-point numbers
bc -l <<< "scale=3; a(30)"
```

### File redirections

`>>` appends new content to the file without removing the old information.

```bash
# adding new information to a diary
echo "Also my favorite things are ..." >> diary.txt

# example with folder
pwd >> ~/todo.txt
echo "^delete if using in docker" >> ~/todo.txt
```

`>` overwrites the file, removing any old content.

```bash
# rewrite/create file content
echo "My new everlasting love is ..." > secret.txt
```

#### stdout, stderr redirections

```bash
# program.sh
echo "Just a normal message"
echo "it will goes to stdout"
# >&2 directs the "ERROR!" message to stderr, represented by descriptor 2
echo "ERROR!" >&2
echo "one more error" >&2
echo "it will goes to stdout too"
echo "one last error" >&2
```

```bash
# 1> redirects all stdout (non-error) output to file
# 2> redirects all stderr output to file
bash program.sh 1> log.txt 2> errors.txt
```

## File Permissions

`drwx------    38 my.username  staff   1.2K Mar  4 13:07 .zsh_sessions`

```bash
# check prmissions
ls -l echo.txt 
-rw-r--r--@ 1 my.user  staff  24 Jun 27 21:15 echo.txt

# change owner
chown superman:marvel ./save_the_world.txt
```

In addition to the user name and group, each file has associated access rights: r - read, w - write and x - execute. These permissions are set for three types of users: the Owner, users belonging to the same group (Group), and Other (those who are not included in the previous two groups).

## Multiple commands in one line

```bash
# No matter the first command run successfully or not, run the second command cmd2:
cd; ls

# Only when the first command cmd1 run successfully, run the second command cmd2
cd && ls

# Only when the first command cmd1 failed to run, run the second command cmd2
cd || ls
```

## Built-in commands

#### examples

To check all available built-in system commands, type `man builtin`

```

### grep

global regular expression print.
prints lines with found text

flags
- `-A <n>` shows the entry and n lines A(fter)
- `-B <n>` shows the entry and n lines B(efore)
- `-C <n>` shows n lines before and after C(ontext)

# Spring
# Summer
# Autumn

echo "The sky is blue" | cut -d ' ' -f 1
# The
```
### tr

can translate, squeeze, and delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output. The program processes the text character by character

`tr <options>... <set1> <set2>`

- `-d` delete
- `-s` remove duplicates

```bash
echo lalala | tr a o
# lololo

echo 'Linux Ubuntu' | tr -d 'u'

## Shell Scripts

### Therms

`#!` - "shebang"
Directive for the Linux program loader that specifies a program that will run the script

`#!/usr/bin/env python3` - python example

### Run a script

* open the corresponding directory with file and type `bash hello_world.sh`
* make the file executable by typing `chmod +x hello_world.sh`
  Then can run it `./hello_world.sh`

### Positional parameters

null parameter `$0` is always the name of the script, and then follows user parameters passed to a script

Syntax

`$#` total number of the parameters
`$* , $@` - all parameters

Example
`personal_data.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "You provided $# facts about yourself!"
echo "Your name is $1"
echo "Your age is $2"
echo "All parameters in one var: $*"
echo "$@" # All arguments passed to the script
```

run

```bash
$ bash personal_data.sh Pepe 13

stdout:
You provided 2 facts about yourself!
Your name is Pepe
Your age is 33
All parameters in line: Pepe 33
All parameters by words: Pepe 33
```

### Functions

syntax

`function function_name {}`
or
`function_name() {}`

example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

personal_data() {
    echo "You provided $# facts about yourself!"
    echo "Your name is $1"
    echo "Your age is $2"
}

personal_data "Elden Lord" 200026
```

### Case statement

case statement is easy to read when there are multiple conditional statements

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

case "${1}" in

    "")       # condition 
        echo "No option was selected." 
        ;; # end of the command
    1)     
        echo "You selected '1'." 
        ;;
    2)     
        echo "You selected '2'." 
        ;;
    3)     
        echo "You selected '3'." 
        ;;
    *)     # default case == else
        echo "Unknown number '${1}'." 
        ;;

esac

# syntax example
case $variable in
    condition-1 )
        commands;;
    condition-2 )
        commands;;
    condition-3 )
        commands;;
    condition-N )
        commands;;
    * )
        commands;;
esac

```


### Shift statement

`shift` - command that helps to iterate within list of arguments in function. like `i++` statement

example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

answers=("a" "d" "c" "a" "a")
total_score=0

for (( i = 0; i < 5; i++));
do
    case "${1}" in

        ${answers[i]})
            ((total_score++))
            ;;
        "-"|"--") # `|` bitwise operator 'OR'
            ;;
        *)
            ((total_score--))
            ;;

    esac
    shift 1 ## equal i + 1
done

echo "Total score is: $total_score"
```

### if-statement

```bash
# syntax
if [conditions]; then
   commands
fi

###
# elif
if test-commands; then
    consequent-commands
elif more-test-commands; then
    more-consequents
else
    some-more-consequents
fi
```

```bash
# Checking the password entered by user

echo "Enter password: "
read input
if [ $input = "Pass!@#" ]; then
    echo "Correct password entered"
fi

###
# add else block
if [ $input = "Pass!@#" ]; then
    echo "Correct password entered"
else
    echo "Incorrect password entered"
fi

###
# elif
num1=20;
num2=10;

if [ "$num1" -eq "$num2" ]; then
    echo "Numbers are equal"
elif [ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]; then
    echo "First number is greater"
else
    echo "Second number is greater"

### Error handling

default, bash does not halt the execution of the script. 
if any command in the pipeline fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the entire pipeline is considered to have failed, even if some commands in the pipeline were successful

`set -euo pipefail` # shell options
	-exit on error
	-undefined vars caused exit
	-output will show last successful command

### Read User Input

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo Write Mario

read mario

# OR with one line
# read -p "Write Mario: " mario

echo "It's me, $mario"
```

### Read file

read lines from file

```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename='example.txt'
while read line; do
    echo "Your line:  $line"
done < "$filename"
```

get lines from file and save to another file

```bash
filename='example.txt'
output='junior.txt'

while read line; do
    echo "Your line:  $line" >> junior.txt
done < "$filename"
```

`/opt/homebrew/bin` - created and maintained by Brew

```bash
# a default $PATH looks like
# search order from left /usr/local/bin to right /sbin
