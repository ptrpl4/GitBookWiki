# RFID

Radio Frequency Identification

RFID is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. RFID tags contain electronically stored information, and RFID systems consist of tags, readers, and a host system

## Operating Frequency

- RFID systems operate at different frequencies, including 
	- Low Frequency (LF) - 125 kHz and 134 kHz (range 1-10m)
	- High Frequency (HF) - around 13.56 MHz (NFC) (range 1-4cm)
	- Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) - between 860 MHz and 960 MHz (10-100m)

- LF RFID commonly used for access control systems, animal tracking, and vehicle immobilization.
- HF RFID used in applications such as contactless payment cards, electronic passports, and library book tracking.
- UHF RFID used in supply chain management, inventory tracking, and asset management

### Fm Frequency

FM radio broadcasting. In Europe and most other parts of the world this band ranges from 87.5 - 108 MHz. In the Americas it starts at 87.8. In Japan  - 76â€“90 MHz. There is no option to have FM on flipper.
