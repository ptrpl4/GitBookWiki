# RFID 125 kHz 

Flipper Zero supports low-frequency (LF) radio frequency identification (RFID) technology that is implemented in access control systems, animal chips, and supply chain tracking systems. Unlike NFC cards, LF RFID cards usually do not provide high levels of security. This technology comes in many form-factors, such as plastic cards, key fobs, tags, wristbands, and animal microchips. Flipper Zero has a low-frequency RFID module capable of reading, saving, emulating, and writing LF RFID cards.
