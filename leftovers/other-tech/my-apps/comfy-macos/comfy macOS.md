### folders

The `/var/folders` directory on macOS contains temporary files and caches used by the system and applications.

System Temporary Files

- Process-specific temporary data
- System caches
- Application caches
- User-specific temporary files

Directory Structure

```bash
/var/folders/
    zz/         # Random two-character directory names
        xxxxxx/ # Long alphanumeric strings
            T/  # Temporary items
            C/  # Caches
```

#### System/User Application folders and tools

```bash
# Privileged Tools & Services
ls -la /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools # tools requiring elevated privileges (e.g., auto-updaters, system services)

ls -la /Library/LaunchAgents # run on user login for all users
ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents # for current user

ls -la /Library/LaunchDaemons/ # run as root, no user login required

# Application Support
ls -la /Library/Application\ Support
ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support

# app preferences
ls -la /Library/Preferences/
ls -la ~/Library/Preferences/

# soft and tools
ls -la /usr/local/bin/ # user CLI tools
ls -la /opt/ # soft (homebrew)

# applications
ls -la /Applications/
ls -la ~/Applications/
```

## Custom 'defaults' settings

macOS applications and other programs use the **defaults** system to record user preferences and other information to be maintained when the application isn't running.

User defaults belong to **domains**, which typically correspond to individual applications. Each domain has a dictionary of keys and values representing its defaults; for example, `"Default Font" = "Helvetica"`. 

Keys are strings, Values can be complex data structures comprising arrays, dictionaries, strings, and binary data. Stored as XML Property Lists.
