What Iâ€™m talking about when I talk about...

## Programs, Tools, Services and  Apps

**Program** - any set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. Basically almost everything is a program

**Tool** - program that perform specific functions and assist users or other software in accomplishing tasks. They are generally not complete applications in themselves but are used to develop, maintain, or facilitate the operation of other software or hardware. \
Therm **Utilities** also could mean a Tool or set of Tools

**Service** - program that can produce/store/change something without user supervising, typically service could be available for end-user via so-called client Application

**Application** - end-user oriented programs

### Summary 

Most end-user programs with a GUI are considered applications. An application can consist of multiple services.
Small, specific programs with a GUI can be called tools or utilities â€“ these are typically smaller programs with a single purpose, or even command-line-only programs.
Services are programs that run in the background and support the operation of other applications or the system itself.

( utils => tools => services => apps ) == program
