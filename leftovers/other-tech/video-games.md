### VSync

Vertical Synchronization -is a technique to synchronize the frame rate of a game or application with the refresh rate of a monitor.
If VSync is enabled, the GPU waits to send a new frame until the monitor is ready to display it. This means the GPU will synchronize its rendering rate with the monitor's refresh rate. If a frame is rendered faster than the monitor's refresh cycle, the GPU waits briefly before sending the next frame, ensuring each frame is displayed completely and without tearing.
