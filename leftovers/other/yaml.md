# üêπ YAML

Human-readable data serialization standard for all programming languages.

### Basic data types <a href="#basic-data-types" id="basic-data-types"></a>

* _integers_ like 15, 123
* _strings_ like "15", 'Hello, YAML!', which may be enclosed either in double or single quotation marks
* _floats_ like 15.033
* _booleans_ (true or false)
* _null type_ (null)

YAML auto-detects the type of data, but users can specify the type they need using `!!`.&#x20;

&#x20;`!!str yes`

### Maps <a href="#maps" id="maps"></a>

Mapping consists of key-value pairs. Pairs are called _scalars._

Indentation is always done with **spaces**, not tabs.

.yaml map example:

```yaml
--- # separator
object: Book # key: value

metadata: # value as a block of scalars (key: value)
  name: Three Men in a Boat
  author: Jerome K Jerome 
  genre: humorous account
  
published:
  year: 1889
  country: United Kingdom
 
# list - block style 
animals:
  - cat
  - dog
  - bird
  
animals: [cat, dog, bird] # list - flow style

# string that preserves newlines instead of a list |
saturday: |
  order cleaning
  order a pizza
  watch new series
```
