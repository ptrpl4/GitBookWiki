What is Program And what is Product

If we're talking about the final product (for the business, for the customer), it's much more than just code or application components. And it takes a lot more time.

Frederick P. Brooks suggested that it would take 3 times as long as the program itself. But that was in 1975...

## Requirements to requirements

- Singularity (1 req = one piece of text)
- Completeness (req is final)
- Consistency (1 req canâ€™t be against 2 req)
- Atomicity (req canâ€™t be divided)
- Traceability (by whom, for what)
- Relevance (we need it)
- Feasibility (We can do it)
- Unambiguity (only one meaning)
- Mandatory (why we need it, if no?)
- Verifiability (we can see, measure changes)

## Requirements analysis

- Feasibility analysis of requirements
- Prioritization of requirements
- Requirements planing
- Creating a dictionary of terms
- Creating a context diagram
- Creation of user interface and technical prototypes

## Project components

### Components

- Money
- Time
- People
- Features
- Quality

### Priority

- Must
- Want
- Skip

### Agile Methodology

#### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

#### 12 Principles

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

#### Main practices of XP

## Therms

### Bus Factor

Bus factor refers to the number of key people on a team who, if they were suddenly hit by a metaphorical bus, would significantly impact the team's ability to function or complete a project.

1 person-  is critical. need more knowledge sharing

2 and more people - more confident

## UI/UX

## Design Strategy

### User-Centered Design (UCD)

User-based design

UCD  is an iterative design process where designers focus on the users and their needs throughout the design process. It involves users through research, requirement definition, design creation, and evaluation. The UCD process is guided by principles such as focusing on the people, solving the right problem, recognizing everything as a system, and not rushing to a solution.

#### Template

_For (**target users**) who wants (**needs**) (**Product X**) is a (**product category**) that have (**one key advantage**). Unlike main competitors - (**Products A, B, C**) our (**Product X**) can do (**unique difference**)._

#### Decision making

Could be based on need of typical users types & typical user groups. We can create a virtual person representing a user group, write their main user stories and main anti-stories.

### Activity-centered design (ACD)

User-based design

* focus on the actions that are taken to solve the problem
* there may be many users
* users may not know what they want
* people adapt well to technology

### Data-driven design

Data-based design

Can be used to improve an existing product

## Product Discovery

### A/B Testing

Experiment to check user statistic in group A with half of users (current flow with no changes) and group B with second half (new flow that expects to increase some metrics).
