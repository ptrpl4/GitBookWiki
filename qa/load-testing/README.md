# ðŸŒ§ Load Testing

Load testing is a process used to assess a system behavior under both normal and anticipated peak load conditions. It helps to:

* **Identify performance bottlenecks** which can be addressed to ensure the system operates smoothly under high load.
* **Ensure reliability and stability** by confirming that the system can handle the expected number of transactions and volume of data.
* **Verify that the system meets performance benchmarks** and service level agreements (SLAs) before it is deployed.
