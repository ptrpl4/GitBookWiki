# ðŸŒ§ Load Testing

Load testing is a process used to assess a system behavior under both normal and anticipated peak load conditions. It helps to:

* **Identify performance bottlenecks** which can be addressed to ensure the system operates smoothly under high load.
* **Ensure reliability and stability** by confirming that the system can handle the expected number of transactions and volume of data.
* **Verify that the system meets performance benchmarks** and service level agreements (SLAs) before it is deployed.

## Types

- **Smoke Testing** â€“ Quick test to check if the system can handle a minimal load without failing.
- **Average Load Testing** â€“ Simulates expected real-world traffic to measure normal performance.
- **Stress Testing** â€“ Pushes the system beyond normal limits to observe how it handles extreme load.
- **Soak Testing** â€“ Runs sustained load for a long period to detect slow performance degradation.
- **Breakpoint Testing** â€“ Identifies the exact point where the system starts failing under load.
- **Spike Testing** â€“ Simulates sudden and extreme traffic surges to test system stability.
