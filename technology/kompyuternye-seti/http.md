# HTTP

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is an [application-layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Layer) protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model), with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a [stateless protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol), meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. Though often based on a TCP/IP layer, it can be used on any reliable [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer), that is, a protocol that doesn't lose messages silently like UDP does.
