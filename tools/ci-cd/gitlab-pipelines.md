# ðŸ¦Š Gitlab pipelines

#### Info

A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages. Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.

#### File Structure

```yaml
# List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
stages:          
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
# This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
build-job:       
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - echo "Compile complete."

# This job runs in the test stage.
unit-test-job:   
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"

# This job also runs in the test stage.
lint-test-job:   
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No lint issues found."

# This job runs in the deploy stage.
deploy-job:      
  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  environment: production
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed.
```

## Jobs

### Job name limitations

You canâ€™t use these keywords as job names:

* `image`
* `services`
* `stages`
* `types`
* `before_script`
* `after_script`
* `variables`
* `cache`
* `include`
* `true`
* `false`
* `nil`

Job names must be 255 characters or fewer.

Use unique names for your jobs. If multiple jobs have the same name, only one is added to the pipeline, and itâ€™s difficult to predict which one is chosen.
