### Continuous Integration

Developers push code changes every day, multiple times a day. For every push to the repository, you can create a set of scripts to **build and test your application automatically**. These scripts help decrease the chances that you introduce errors in your application.\
This practice is known as Continuous Integration. Each change submitted to an application, even to development branches, is built and tested automatically and continuously. These tests ensure the changes pass all tests, guidelines, and code compliance standards you established for your application.

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is a step beyond Continuous Integration. Not only is your application built and tested each time a code change is pushed to the codebase, the application is also deployed continuously. However, with continuous delivery, you trigger the deployments manually.\
Continuous Delivery checks the code automatically, but **it requires human intervention** to manually and strategically trigger the deployment of the changes.

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is another step beyond Continuous Integration, similar to Continuous Delivery. The difference is that instead of deploying your application manually, you set it to be deployed automatically. **Human intervention is not required**.
